## Motivation
* To further understand the relationship between React, Redux, and Redux Toolkit Query

## Stack
* React
  * Used to build the components for the list of users and each of their photo albums 
* Redux
  * Used thunks to track the state of users
* Redux Toolkit Query
  * Used to create APIs to track the state of photos and albums of users
  * Used tags to identify photos and refetch them
* TailwindCSS
  * Used CSS animations to show an animated skeleton of elements on the page while a request is loading or fetching 

## How to Use
* The page uses "faker-js" to generate random images into the albums when the "Add Photo" button is clicked inside each album.
* The page uses "json-server" to create the full fake REST api to build out the back-end to store the images, albums, and users data
* Running the Program: `npm run start`
* Running the Server: `npm run start:server`

## Upcoming Features
- [ ] Add some color to different elements on the page to increase visibility between elements
- [ ] Add ability for the user to upload their own image
- [ ] Add ability for the user to rename their photo albums (currently being randomly generated by faker-js)
- [ ] Rework deletion of images (currently it's done by just clicking anywhere on the image).
- [ ] Afterwords, add the ability to show the full size version of the image when it is clicked on.
